Rhythm and Flow was born from the vibrant imagination of Albert Ramon Jr (DJ Inferno) and the creative vision of Miguel Canchola (Madebypowr) in March of 2023. Hailing from the dynamic hip-hop scene of Los Angeles, DJ Inferno discovered a void in the musical landscape upon settling in Salem, Oregon. Motivated by a passion to infuse the Pacific Northwest, particularly Salem, with the energetic vibes of the West Coast, DJ Inferno embarked on a mission to redefine the hip-hop narrative.

What started as a modest event on a random Thursday quickly transformed into a series of five extraordinary shows, each resonating with sold-out audiences. Rhythm and Flow is more than just a musical spectacle---it's a transformative experience for the community, with a special emphasis on uplifting the minority community, which serves as the heartbeat of hip-hop culture.
